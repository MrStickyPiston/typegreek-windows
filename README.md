### About 
The program is written to simplify typing ancient greek on standard keyboards.
Without this program you have to go to a site, enter what you want to type, copy it, and paste it where you were typing.
Thats not very neat.

### Installation
1. Download the latest release at [releases](https://github.com/MrStickyPiston/typegreek-windows/releases/latest).
Choose the .exe file for the language you want.  
2. If your browser says "Typegreek.exe is not being downloaded much and can be dangerous" or something along those lines, click setting > keep. The file will download now.  
3. (Double)click the downloaded file. If windows defender says "Your pc is being protected" click more info > run anyways. Windows defender says this because we didnt buy a 300$ license for a free program.  
4. A window will pop up now with keybinds and other info. You are done with the installation!
If no window pops up, wou most likely have a outdated windows system.
This is not a problem, but you have to compile the program yourself.

To do that, you complete these simple steps:

1. Download and install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download the latest source code.zip at [releases](https://github.com/MrStickyPiston/typegreek-windows/releases/latest).
3. Extract the zip.
4. Open autohotkey and select the extracted typegreek_EN.ahk as source.
5. Click convert. Autohotkey will say that the script compiled succesfully.
6. Go to the position of the typegreek_EN.ahk file.
7. (Double)click the typegreek_EN.exe file.
8. The window will popup now.

### Usage
If you have installed the program, just (double)click the file again to start it up.
