### About 
The program is written to simplify typing ancient greek on standard keyboards.
Without this program you have to go to a site, enter what you want to type, copy it, and paste it where you were typing.
Thats not very neat.

### Installation
1. Download the latest release at [releases](https://github.com/MrStickyPiston/typegreek-windows/releases/latest)  
2. If your browser says "Typegreek.exe is not being downloaded much and can be dangerous" or something along those lines, click setting > keep. The file will download now.  
3. (Double)click the downloaded file. If windows defender says "Your pc is being protected" click more info > run anyways. Windows defender says this because we didnt buy a 300$ license for a free program.  
4. A window will pop up now with keybinds and other info. You are done with the installation!

### Usage
If you have installed the program, just (double)click the file again to start it up.
