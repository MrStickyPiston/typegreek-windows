### About 
The program is written to simplify typing ancient greek on standard keyboards.
Without this program you have to go to a site, enter what you want to type, copy it, and paste it where you were typing.
Thats not very neat.

### Installation
1. Download the latest release at [releases](https://github.com/MrStickyPiston/typegreek-windows/releases/latest).
Choose the .exe file for the language you want.
